 * üìå Problem: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
 * 
 * Leetcode: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/
 * 
 * ‚úÖ Objective:
 *   Given an array where each element represents the stock price on that day,
 *   find the maximum profit you can achieve by buying on one day and selling on another later day.
 *   ‚ùó You are allowed to make **only one transaction** (buy once and sell once).
 * 
 * üß† Intuition:
 *   - To maximize profit, buy at the **lowest price** seen so far,
 *     and sell at the current price if it gives better profit.
 * 
 * ‚úÖ Approach:
 *   - Initialize minPrice = prices[0], maxProfit = 0
 *   - For each day:
 *     - Update minPrice if current price is lower
 *     - Calculate profit = current price - minPrice
 *     - Update maxProfit if profit is greater than current max
 * 
 * ‚úÖ Time Complexity: O(n)
 * ‚úÖ Space Complexity: O(1)
 * 
 * üîç Edge Cases:
 *   - Array length < 2 ‚Üí no transaction possible ‚Üí return 0
 *   - Prices always decreasing ‚Üí maxProfit = 0 (no gain)
 *   - All prices equal ‚Üí maxProfit = 0
